# Source Water Time Machine: California Public Water Systems Source Locations and Information App Documentation

## Introduction
The State Water Boardâ€™s Division of Drinking Water (DDW) regulates approximately 7,500 public water systems (PWS) in California. A PWS is defined as a system that provides drinking water for human consumption to 15 or more connections or regularly serves 25 or more people daily for at least 60 days out of the year. The DDW allocates permits for PWS, and collects an annual report from each system.
